## Description
This is my submission for nestjs assessment. I've utilized following features throught the application
1) Decorators
2) Dependency Injection
3) Guards (AuthGaurd for restricting access to api so that only login person can acess the api)
4) Middleware (SessionMiddlewre for managing sessions using express-session)
5) Pipes (Validation pipe for validation and transformation)
6) Interceptors (I could not think of a situation suitable for interceptors so, instead of adding a logging interceptor I've decided not to use them)
